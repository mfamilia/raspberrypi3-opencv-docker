## About
The Git repo of an [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mohaseeb/raspberrypi3-python-opencv/)
, for Raspberry Pi 3 with Raspbian OS (Debian). The modules from OpenCV 
contrib are included as well.  It is based on [the resin.io python image](https://hub.docker.com/r/resin/raspberrypi3-python/).

## Usage
See [the image Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/mohaseeb/raspberrypi3-python-opencv/)
 for information on how to use the image.

## Build
If you prefer to build the image yourself (takes around 2 hours), you can do it as follows:
* Make sure docker is installed in your Raspberry Pi. See [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/docker-comes-to-raspberry-pi/) for 
instructions.
* Clone this repository into your Raspberry Pi.
```commandline
git clone git@github.com:mohaseeb/raspberrypi3-opencv-docker.git
```
* Build the image by running:
```commandline
cd raspberrypi3-opencv-docker/
docker build -t my_pi_opencv_img .
```
* And run it
```commandline
docker run -it --rm \
       --name my_opencv_app_run \
       my_pi_opencv_img \
       python -c "import cv2; print(cv2.__version__)"
```
* And here is how you can capture video using your Raspberry Pi camera.
<br>Save the video capturing script to a file named [save_video.py](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_gui/py_video_display/py_video_display.html#saving-a-video) in your Raspberry Pi.
```python
import cv2

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

# Define the codec and create VideoWriter object
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'XVID')
out = cv2.VideoWriter('/videos/output.avi', fourcc, 20.0, (640, 480))
n_frames = 200
while n_frames > 0:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if ret == True:
        # write the flipped frame
        out.write(frame)
        n_frames -= 1
    else:
        break
    print('frames to capture: {}'.format(n_frames))

# Release everything when done
cap.release()
out.release()
``` 
Execute the script as follows (assumes the camera appears as /dev/vidoe0 on 
the Raspberry Pi)
```bash
docker run -it --rm \
    -v `pwd`/save_video.py:/save_video.py \
    -v `pwd`:/videos \
    --device /dev/video0 \
    my_pi_opencv_img \
    python /save_video.py
```
The captured video will be written to file named output.avi in the current 
directory.
